# utensil
A collection of tools named after kitchen utensils.
## Syntax
Utensils works like this:
> utensil program example.c
> 
basically, you specify which program you want to run, and then give an argument. You can also list the available programs using:
> utensil list

## Program listing

spatula - shell script to quickly make a development environment
fork - program that looks through C source code and finds lines not ending a semicolon or some other characters.

## Why utensils?
Because when I was thinking of a name for a project, I was licking the chocolate off a spatula after putting brownies into an oven, and then everything else also had to be named after a utensil.
