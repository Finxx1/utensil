# Fork
A tool for making sure you did not miss a semicolon in c-like languages
## WTF is this file structure?
It was generated by [spatula](https://github.com/Finxx1/spatula)
## How Does it Work?
Fork works by looking at your file and finding lines that dont end in a variety of characters such as ```;``` and ```>```
## Installation
Usually there will be binaries for your system. If not however, you have to compile the program yourself. Just use GCC/Mingw-w64 if your on windows and GCC on unix.
## How does the _code_ work?
Check [this](dev.md) out.
